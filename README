Non-Genotoxic Carcinogens (Nicht gentoxische Kanzerogene)
=========================================================

Benutzt wurde:

canc2_1  =  3 und
   Gen  !=  3

aus dem Excel-File 'src/SA_ISSCANv3aresTT1.51_sum.xls' um Verbindungen als kanzerogen *und* nicht gentoxisch zu kennzeichnen (s. NonGenToxCarc.smi und NonGenToxCarc.class) entsprechend Aldos Empfehlung (s.u.).

Beachte Datei 'src/unspec'. Diese enth√§lt 16 aus dem Originaldatensatz ausgeschlossene Verbindungen, die openbabel nicht konvertieren konnte.

Statistik:

1153 NonGenToxCarc.class # Die ausgeschlossenen Verbindungen wurde aus der .class-Datei nicht entfernt

Hi Andreas

You may want to use the two following files.

The .sdf file is the ISSCAN v3a database on chemical carcinogens, where you can get the structures (also downloadable freely from the ISS website).

The .xls file has been generated by running the .sdf file with Toxtree (also freely available from JRC QSAR). The linkage is through the ID of the chemicals ("substance" column in the .xls file).

You may be mainly interested in variables:

Canc2-1 = carcinogen = 3; noncarcinogen = 1
Gen     = 3, if there is an alert for genotoxic carcinogenicity
Non Gen = 3, if there is an alert for nongenotox carcinogenicity.

Some carcinogens have no known alert, and probably are non genotoxic. Thus, I suggest to exclude from the analysis all the chemicals with an alert for genotoxic carcinogenicity, and then start the search for new nongenotoxic alerts by contrasting carcinogens versus noncarcinogens in the remaining set.

Please keep me informed. I am curious about your results; we have started a mechanistic analysis in this sense, and it would be interesting to see if there is any overlap.

Ciao

Dear Aldo,

Some time ago you sent me a chemical database for the
nongenotoxic carcinogenicity endpoint, thank you again. I have a
question. You state that:

Canc2-1=       carcinogen = 3; noncarcinogen = 1
Gen  =          3 if there is an alert for genotoxic carcinogenicity
Non Gen =     3 if there is an alert for nongenotox carcinogenicity.

I am not sure what "Gen" exactly means.
Because, if "3" in that field is an alert calculated by some algorithm,
that is not what we need (actually, we want to compute this ourselves).
Instead, we would need experimental values here that we can model.
Thank you very much.

Greetings
Andreas

Hi Andreas,

If I understand correctly, you would like to identify in an automatic way the alerts for nongenotoxic carcinogens.
This means you need some way of discriminating between genotoxic and nongenotoxic carcinogens, given that Canc2-1 is the experimental value for carcinogenicity (=3 means a positive result).

You have three options to discriminate between genotoxic and nongenotoxic carcinogens:

1) among the experimental carcinogens, you will consider as genotoxic the carcinogens with a positive Salmonella result (SAL = 3);

2) among the experimental carcinogens, you will consider as genotoxic the carcinogens with an alert for genotoxic carcinogenicity (Gen = 3);

3)  among the experimental carcinogens, you will consider as genotoxic the carcinogens with either a positive Salmonella result (SAL = 3), or an alert for genotoxic carcinogenicity (Gen = 3).

Once you have identified the genotoxic carcinogens, you will focus your analysis on the "other" carcinogens, by contrasting them with the noncarcinogens.

The decision regarding the criterion for genoxoticity or nongenotoxicity is up to you.

In my opinion, the best and most consistent option is Option 2. This because it is possible to apply the search for alerts to all the carcinogens, whereas several experimental SAL values are not available (especially the good quality SAL values that we have included in our curated ISSCAN database). In addition, we have shown that SAL and the alerts are equivalent models for genotoxic carcinogenicity.

Hope this answers your questions.

If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to ask.

Ciao
