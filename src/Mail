Hi Andreas

You may want to use the two following files.

The .sdf file is the ISSCAN v3a database on chemical carcinogens, where you can get the structures (also downloadable freely from the ISS website).

The .xcl file has been generated by running the .sdf file with Toxtree (also freely available from JRC QSAR). The linkage is through the ID of the chemicals ("substance" column in the .xcl file).

You may be mainly interested in variables:

Canc2-1=       carcinogen = 3; noncarcinogen = 1
Gen  =          3 if there is an alert for genotoxic carcinogenicity
Non Gen =     3 if there is an alert for nongenotox carcinogenicity.

Some carcinogens have no known alert, and probably are non genotoxic. Thus, I suggest to exclude from the analysis all the chemicals with an alert for genotoxic carcinogenicity, and then start the search for new nongenotoxic alerts by contrasting carcinogens versus noncarcinogens in the remaining set.

Please keep me informed. I am curious about your results; we have started a mechanistic analysis in this sense, and it would be interesting to see if there is any overlap.

Ciao

Aldo
